### Project Overview
---
This data analysis project allows to provide insights into the spotify analysis dataset which was sourced from kaggle. It provides analysis on the no of streams, track name, artiste, year etc. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, make data driven reccomendation and gain deeper understanding of the company's performance. Spotify is a popular music streaming platform that provides a rich dataset containing a wide range of information about tracks, artists, albums, and user interactions. My goal was to extract meaningful insights from this data and present them through interactive and informative visualizations.

### Data Sources
Kaggle: The Spotify dataset was sourced from Kaggle, a popular platform for data science competitions and datasets.

### Tools
- Kaggle- Source
- Power BI- Data Cleaning and visualization was done here
- Git Hub- Documentation
  
### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
- Data Loading and inspection
- Handling missing Values
- Data Cleaning and formating

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Number of streams by year
- Count of tracks by artist
- Number of streams by artiste
- Artist count by Key

## DATA ANALYSIS
### Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:
- Data Collection and Preprocessing: This section covers how we acquired the Spotify dataset, cleaned and preprocessed it to prepare it for analysis in Power BI.
- Power BI Dashboards: Here, you'll find the interactive dashboards and reports created in Power BI, showcasing various aspects of Spotify data.
- Analysis and Insights: We delve into the insights and findings from the data analysis, highlighting trends, patterns, and interesting discoveries.
- Documentation: Detailed instructions on how to use the Power BI dashboard, explanations of visualizations, and methodologies applied in the project.
- Contributing: Information on how to contribute to the project, report issues, or suggest improvements.

### Results/Findings
Amid our exploration, some fascinating revelations emerged. We noticed that Taylor Swift stood as the artist with the highest number of tracks, reflecting her prolific and diverse musical career. The Weeknd, on the other hand, emerged as the artist with the highest number of streams, indicating his immense popularity among Spotify users. Further, the year 2022 marked an exceptional milestone as it witnessed the highest number of streams, signaling a remarkable surge in Spotify's user engagement and music consumption. To ensure that these insights were easily accessible and customizable, we designed an interactive dashboard using Power BI. This dashboard empowers users to delve into the dataset, apply filters, and perform drill-down analyses to uncover their unique perspectives on the music data.

### Recommendations
The fascinating revelations from our Spotify analysis present exciting opportunities to take action and enhance the user experience. Here are some recommendations:
- Explore potential collaborations with popular artists, such as Taylor Swift and The Weeknd, to create exclusive content, special releases, or promotions that celebrate their contributions to the platform.
- Curated Playlists for The Weeknd: Given The Weeknd's popularity and high number of streams, create specialized playlists that highlight his best work. This approach can appeal to his fan base and potentially attract new listeners who appreciate his distinctive style.
- Year-Specific Playlists: To leverage the exceptional milestone of 2022 with the highest number of streams, curate "Year-Specific Playlists" that encapsulate the top tracks and trending artists of that year. These playlists will not only resonate with users who want to relive the music of 2022 but also serve as a historical archive for future listeners.
- Engage Users: Encourage user engagement by asking them to contribute to the creation of these playlists. Allow users to suggest tracks, artists, or themes for new playlists. This fosters a sense of community and involvement.
- Explore potential collaborations with popular artists, such as Taylor Swift and The Weeknd, to create exclusive content, special releases, or promotions that celebrate their contributions to the platform.
### Limitations
During the data cleaning, i replaced the errors with null values so it would not affect the quality of my analysis. In the future, I anticipate expanding on this project by introducing new features to the Power BI dashboard, integrating additional data sources, and conducting even more profound analyses to unearth further valuable insights from Spotify's rich music data. I am  excited to continue exploring the ever-evolving world of music and its data. I hope you find this project both informative and enthralling. If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, I welcome you to reach out to me. Thank you for visiting the GitHub repository and embarking on this extraordinary journey of Spotify analysis with Power BI.
