# SPOTIFY ANALYSIS SAMPLE PROJECT
### Project Overview
This data analysis project allows to provide insights into the spotify analysis dataset which was sourced from kaggle. It provides analysis on the no of streams, track name, artiste, year etc. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, make data driven reccomendation and gain deeper understanding of the company's performance. Spotify is a popular music streaming platform that provides a rich dataset containing a wide range of information about tracks, artists, albums, and user interactions. My goal was to extract meaningful insights from this data and present them through interactive and informative visualizations.

### Data Sources
Kaggle: The Spotify dataset was sourced from Kaggle, a popular platform for data science competitions and datasets.

### Tools
- Kaggle- Source
- Power BI- Data Cleaning and visualization was done here
- Git Hub- Documentation
  
### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
- Data Loading and inspection
- Handling missing Values
- Data Cleaning and formating

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Results/Findings
Amid our exploration, some fascinating revelations emerged. We noticed that Taylor Swift stood as the artist with the highest number of tracks, reflecting her prolific and diverse musical career. The Weeknd, on the other hand, emerged as the artist with the highest number of streams, indicating his immense popularity among Spotify users. Further, the year 2022 marked an exceptional milestone as it witnessed the highest number of streams, signaling a remarkable surge in Spotify's user engagement and music consumption. To ensure that these insights were easily accessible and customizable, we designed an interactive dashboard using Power BI. This dashboard empowers users to delve into the dataset, apply filters, and perform drill-down analyses to uncover their unique perspectives on the music data.
